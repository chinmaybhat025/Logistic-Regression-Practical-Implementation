Logistic Regression is the first classification alogorithm which helps to you to provide linear boundry between two classes. it is also useful for multiclass classification.

Logistic Regression works on the following basic assumption:-

 Linear Relation between independent features and the log odds.
 
 Advantages of Logistics Regression

1. Logistic Regression Are very easy to understand
2. It requires less training
3. Good accuracy for many simple data sets and it performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.

 Disadvantages
1. Sometimes Lot of Feature Engineering Is required
2. If the independent features are correlated it may affect performance
3. Non-linear problems canâ€™t be solved with logistic regression because it has a linear decision surface. Linearly separable data is rarely found in real-world scenarios.

Whether Feature Scaling is required? yes

Missing Values ? Sensitive to missing values

Types of Problems it solves:- Classification


Performance Metrics:-
1. Confusion Matrix 
2. Precision,Recall, F1 score

Note:-Which Performance Metric to be used is solely based on the type of use case you are solving.
